# Research Proposal: ENSO-Driven South African Flood Analysis

## Objective

This project aims to quantitatively test the hypothesis that the extreme South African floods of 2011 were a direct consequence of a specific phase in the El Niño‑Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, rather than primarily attributable to long‑term anthropogenic warming. The analysis will focus on the poleward redistribution of solar energy via atmospheric and oceanic currents during the 2010‑2011 La Niña event.

## Proposed Methodology for Milestone 2

### 1. Quantifying Energy Redistribution
We will use reanalysis datasets (e.g., ERA5) to compute the meridional heat transport in the atmosphere and ocean over the period 2009–2012. Key metrics will include:
- **Atmospheric Heat Transport (AHT):** Integrated northward transport of dry static energy and latent heat across key latitude bands (e.g., 30°S–40°S).
- **Oceanic Heat Transport (OHT):** Derived from ocean reanalysis products (e.g., ORAS5) to capture the anomalous poleward transport driven by ENSO‑related wind stress and thermocline adjustments.

### 2. Relating ENSO Phase to Regional Precipitation
A composite analysis will be performed, comparing the 2010‑2011 La Niña event against other strong La Niña events in the historical record. We will:
- Calculate the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) for the target period and identify the precise timing of the La Niña peak.
- Correlate the ONI phase with precipitation anomalies over the eastern coast of South Africa using high‑resolution gridded precipitation datasets (e.g., CHIRPS, TRMM).
- Isolate the fraction of the 2011 flood rainfall that can be statistically explained by the ENSO state, after removing the long‑term warming trend.

### 3. Attribution Framework
A detection‑and‑attribution approach will be employed to separate the ENSO‑forced signal from the anthropogenic background. This will involve:
- Constructing a “ENSO‑only” counterfactual by subtracting the multi‑model mean response to greenhouse‑gas forcing (from CMIP5/CMIP6 historical runs) from the observed anomalies.
- Comparing the residual anomalies with the simulated ENSO‑related variability from models that capture the observed ENSO–precipitation teleconnections.

By following this methodology, we intend to demonstrate that the 2011 floods were a predictable outcome of a well‑defined ENSO phase, and that Global Climate Models (GCMs) failed to anticipate the event because they either misrepresent the timing/intensity of the La Niña or its teleconnections to southern Africa.
