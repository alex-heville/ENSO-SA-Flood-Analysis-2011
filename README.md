# ENSO-SA-Flood-Analysis-2011

## Central Hypothesis

The extreme South African floods of 2011 were primarily a consequence of a specific, predictable phase in the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, which drove an anomalous poleward redistribution of solar energy via atmospheric and oceanic currents. This hypothesis challenges the prevailing narrative that attributes the event primarily to long-term anthropogenic climate change.

## Primary Objective

To test the ENSO-driven hypothesis against mainstream climate change attributions by demonstrating a more direct causal link to ENSO dynamics and the failure of Global Climate Models (GCMs) to capture it.

## Scope

This project focuses on the 2011 South African flood event, analyzing the period from 2009 to 2012 to capture the relevant ENSO phases and associated climatic anomalies.

## Project Structure

This repository contains:
- Research proposal (`RESEARCH_PROPOSAL.md`)
- Data sourcing documentation (via issues)
- Methodology and model critique
- Comparative analysis framework

## Getting Started

Researchers can review the issues for specific tasks and milestones. The `main` branch holds the finalized research proposal, while active development branches will contain experimental analyses.
